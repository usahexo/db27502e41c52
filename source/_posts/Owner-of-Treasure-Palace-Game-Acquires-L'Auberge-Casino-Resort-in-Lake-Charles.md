#  Billionaire Investor Purchases L'Auberge Casino Resort

Billionaire investor Carl Icahn has agreed to purchase L'Auberge Casino Resort in Baton Rouge, Louisiana from Pinnacle Entertainment for $616 million.

L'Auberge Casino Resort is a AAA Four Diamond resort that features 122,000 square feet of casino gaming space, including 1,600 slot machines and 90 table games. The property also features a 54-room hotel, spa, and several restaurants.

The acquisition of L'Auberge Casino Resort marks Icahn's entry into the Louisiana gambling market. In a statement announcing the deal, Icahn said he was "excited to have the opportunity to own and operate a top-notch casino resort in Baton Rouge."

Pinnacle Entertainment had been seeking a buyer for L'Auberge Casino Resort since last year, when the company put itself up for sale. In November 2017, Pinnacle reached an agreement to sell the property to Eldorado Resorts for $873 million, but the deal fell through in February 2018.

Icahn is no stranger to the casino industry. The 80-year-old investor is currently the largest shareholder of Tropicana Entertainment, which owns and operates nine casinos and resorts in the United States.

#  Renowned Casino Resort Sold to Unknown Investor

The world-renowned casino resort known as "The Strip" has been sold to an unknown investor for an undisclosed amount of money. The new owner is said to be a reclusive businessperson who has never been involved in the casino industry before.

This news has come as a shock to many employees and guests of the establishment, as the new owner has made no indication that he plans to change anything about the resort. In a statement, the reclusive investor said only that he is "very excited about this new venture" and hopes to "make Las Vegas even more famous than it already is."

When asked for comment, employees of the casino resort were tight-lipped, saying only that they are "waiting to see what happens next." Regular guests of the casino were also reluctant to speak on the record, but all seemed to agree that the sale was something of a surprise.

The Strip has been a fixture of Las Vegas since its construction in 1971. It was originally built by Howard Hughes and has had several different owners over the years. The resort is known for its luxurious accommodations, including several high-end restaurants and a world-class spa.

#  Mystery Investor Buys Louisiana's L'Auberge Casino Resort

The future of Louisiana's L'Auberge Casino Resort is now in the hands of a mystery investor.

On Monday, it was announced that the casino had been sold to an unidentified individual for an undisclosed sum. This comes after a long and difficult process to find a buyer for the property.

L'Auberge Casino Resort has been operational since 2012 and was one of the first major gambling establishments to open in the state. It features a 300-room hotel, a 30,000-square-foot gaming floor, and several restaurants.

However, it has faced significant financial difficulties in recent years. In 2017, its parent company declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This led to the casino being put up for sale later that year.

The identity of the new owner has not been released, but they are expected to keep the property running as is. Representatives from L'Auberge Casino Resort have declined to comment on the sale.
