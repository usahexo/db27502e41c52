#  Tax Free Gambling Winnings in Netherlands!

Many people are not aware that gambling winnings in The Netherlands are tax free. This is a great perk for Dutch players, as they can enjoy their wins without having to worry about giving a portion of their profits to the government.

There are some conditions that must be met in order to qualify for this tax exemption. Winnings must be generated from approved forms of gambling, such as lotteries, betting, and casino games. The amount won cannot exceed € 4,000 per year, and the player must have been present in the Netherlands at the time of the win.

Foreign players are also able to enjoy this tax break, as long as they meet the same requirements. Gambling winnings earned while visiting the Netherlands are tax free, regardless of how much money is won.

This makes The Netherlands a great destination for international players who want to enjoy some tax-free gambling action. There are plenty of casinos and betting venues available, so players can find something to suit their needs. With all of the excitement available at these establishments, it’s easy to see why many people choose to visit The Netherlands specifically for gambling purposes!

#  $100,000 Tax-Free Casino Win in Canada!

On October 12, 2017, an Ontario man hit a whopping $100,000 jackpot at Casino Niagara – and he walked away without paying a dime in taxes!

How did he do it? Well, the casino is located on Native American territory, and Canadians aren’t required to pay taxes on any winnings won on Native American soil.

While this tax loophole may soon be closed, as the Canadian government has been hinting at doing for some time now, there’s still plenty of time to take advantage of it if you’re lucky enough to hit the jackpot.

So what are you waiting for? Head to your nearest Native American casino and see if you can strike it rich!

#  Lucky Gambler Wins €1.5 Million Tax-Free in Malta!

It was a typical Wednesday night in Malta when a lucky gambler hit the jackpot at the online casino, walking away with an impressive €1.5 million tax-free.

The anonymous player had been betting on slots and table games for just over two hours when they hit the big pot, scooping up a total of 246,819.04 Euros.

This is the second big win at this casino in just three months, with another lucky player pocketing over half a million Euros in March.

Malta is quickly becoming known as one of the luckiest countries in Europe for online casino players, with a string of big payouts making headlines in the past year.

In fact, the Maltese government has even seen fit to increase its taxes on gambling companies in a bid to capitalise on this good fortune.

So what is it that makes Malta so lucky for online casino players?

One theory is that the country’s favourable tax laws are a major attraction for high-rolling gamblers. Casinos based in Malta are exempt from paying any income tax, which means players can keep more of their winnings.

Another possible explanation is that Malta’s gaming regulations are among the most lenient in Europe. This means casinos operating in Malta are less likely to refuse payouts or cancel bonuses without warning.

Whatever the reason, it looks like Maltese casino players are enjoying some serious good luck lately! If you want to be in with a chance of following in their footsteps, check out our list of recommended casinos below.

#  Get Ready to Pay Taxes on Your Gambling Winnings in the UK! 

Gamblers in the United Kingdom need to be aware that they will be required to pay taxes on their gambling winnings from April 2019. The new rules, which were announced in last year’s budget, will see those who win more than £30,000 taxed at a rate of 20%. This is a change from the current system, whereby gamblers only have to pay tax on winnings above £11,700.

The government says that the new rules are necessary in order to bring the UK in line with other countries where gambling taxes are already in place. They also argue that the changes will help to protect vulnerable people who may be addicted to gambling. However, not everyone is happy with the proposed changes, with some arguing that they will do more harm than good.

So what does this mean for gamblers in the UK? Well, if you’re one of the lucky ones and happen to win big at the casino, you can expect to pay around 20% of your winnings in taxes. This could amount to a lot of money if you’re lucky enough to hit it big, so it’s important to factor this into your calculations if you’re thinking of gambling your way to riches.

Of course, not everyone will be affected by the new rules – those who only win small amounts of money won’t have to worry about paying any taxes. But for those who are hoping to make some serious profits from gaming, it’s important to be aware of the impending changes and plan accordingly. So far there has been no news on whether or not these rules will apply to offshore betting sites, but we can expect more information on this in the coming months.

#  German Gambler pockets €180,000 Tax-Free from Slot Machine Win!

A German gambler has pocketed a whopping 180,000 euros tax-free from a slot machine win - and he hasn't even had to leave his home country to do it!

The lucky player, who has chosen to remain anonymous, hit the jackpot on a Novomatic online slot game which is available to German players. The winnings are even more remarkable when you consider that the average online casino payout percentage is just 95%.

This isn't the first big win for this particular gambler; in fact, he's previously won more than 1.2 million euros playing Novomatic slots. Commenting on his latest windfall, the delighted player said "I don't think I'll ever get tired of winning like this - it's just brilliant!"

While the win may seem like it's come out of nowhere, the player actually started off with a relatively modest bankroll of just 100 euros. After wagering this amount over the course of 15 minutes or so, he found himself up by an impressive 180,000 euros. Talk about lucky!

With such a sizeable win under his belt, you might be wondering what the lucky German plans to do with all that cash. Well, he's already announced that he'll be using some of it to buy himself a new car and take a much-needed vacation. Nice one!
