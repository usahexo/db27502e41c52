#  Bursaspor Rides Wave of Momentum Into Match vs. Antalyaspor 

Bursaspor's recent success has been a sight to behold. The team has now notched up six wins from their last seven outings in all competitions, and they will be looking to keep the good times rolling when they face Antalyaspor on Saturday.

Incredibly, Bursaspor have now won each of their last five matches at home - a run that started with a 2-1 victory over Sivasspor on October 20th. This impressive form at the Ulker Stadyumu has seen the Green Crocodiles rocket up the Super Lig table, and they currently find themselves in fifth place, just two points off leaders Galatasaray.

Saturday's showdown with Antalyaspor is therefore shaping up to be a pivotal match in the race for the title. Bursaspor will enter into it in confident mood after their exploits against Akhisar Belediyespor last time out. The game finished 3-0 in favour of the home side, with goals coming from Dorukhan Tokoz, Ozan Tufan and Muhammed Demirci.

It was an excellent performance from Bursaspor, and one that will have given manager Şenol Güneş plenty of cause for satisfaction. The veteran tactician has overseen an impressive turnaround at the club since taking over in the summer, and he will be keen to ensure that his team continues to progress up the table.

Saturday's clash with Antalyaspor is likely to provide a stern test for Bursaspor, but with their tails up following their recent run of good form, they should be confident of getting a positive result.

#  OddsShark: What Does Money Line + Spread Mean in Sports Gambling? 

Like any other type of gambling, sports betting comes with its own set of terminology that can be confusing for first timers. The Money Line + Spread is one the most common terms in sports betting, so let's take a look at what it means and how it can be used.

The Money Line + Spread is essentially a combination of two different bets. The first part, called the Money Line, is a bet on who will win the game. The second part, called the Spread, is a bet on how many points one team will beat the other team by.

Consider an example. Let's say you want to place a bet on the Washington Capitals to beat the Dallas Stars. The Money Line for this game would be Washington -180 and Dallas +160. This means that if you want to bet on Washington to win, you would have to wager $180 in order to win $100. If you wanted to bet on Dallas instead, your payoff would be $160 for every $100 you wager. 

The Spread is more complicated than the Money Line, but it essentially just measures how confident Vegas is in one team beating another. In our example, the Spread would be Washington -1 and Dallas +1. This means that Dallas is expected to lose by only one point and Washington is expected to win by at least two points. 

If you wanted to bet on Washington to cover the spread (meaning they would have to win by more than one point), then your payout would be $100 for every $130 you wager. If you wanted to bet on Dallas instead, then your payout would be $120 for every $100 wagered. 

So why would anyone ever use the Money Line + Spread? Well, using these two bets together gives you a better chance of winning than if you were to just place a bet on either the Money Line or the Spread alone. For example, let's say that you think Washington will beat Dallas by more than one point but are not quite sure if they'll win by enough to cover the spread. Well, then you could place a bet on Washington -1 and hope that they still manage to win by more than one point but also collect your payout if they only win by a single point. 

In short, using the Money Line + Spread gives you better odds of winning than just betting on either the Money Line or Spread alone.

#  Turkey's Bursaspor Faces Critical Test Versus Antalyaspor 

In the latest edition of the Turkish Super Lig, Bursaspor will face off against Antalyaspor. This matchup is shaping up to be a critical one for Bursaspor, as they look to redeem themselves after a string of disappointing results.

Bursaspor come into this match in 7th place in the league table, with 21 points from 16 matches. They have won just 5 of those 16 matches, and have lost 4 times. Their recent form has been particularly poor, with just 1 win in their last 5 league matches. In their last match, they were beaten 2-1 by Alanyaspor.

Antalyaspor are currently in 5th place in the league table, with 25 points from 17 matches. They have won 7 of those 17 matches, and lost 5 times. Like Bursaspor, their recent form has been poor, with just 1 win in their last 5 league matches. In their last match, they were beaten 2-0 by Kasimpasa.

This matchup should be a close one, with both sides vying for all 3 points. However, Bursaspor's recent form suggests that they may struggle to get a result in this match. Antalyaspor are likely to go out and attack from the start, so Bursaspor may need to be wary of being caught on the counterattack.

#  Bursapor Looks To Take Next Step With Win Over Antalyaspor 

Bursapor will look to take the next step in their season when they host Antalyaspor on Saturday.

Bursapor come into the game with two wins and a draw from their last three games, while Antalyaspor have one win, one draw and one defeat from their last three.

In the last meeting between the two sides, Bursapor ran out 3-1 winners, thanks to goals from Deniz Naki, Yusuf Yazici and Orhan Gulle.

Naki looks set to miss out once again for Bursapor through suspension, but Yazici could start after coming off the bench to score against Sivasspor last time out.

For Antalyaspor, Samuel Eto’o is expected to lead the line after scoring in his last two matches.

#  Can Bursaspor Channel Positive Energy Into Victory Over Antalyaspor?

Bursaspor will be looking to make it two wins from their last two games when they welcome Antalyaspor to the Bursa Atatürk Stadium on Saturday.

The Green-Weißer's (Green-Whites) have made a decent start to the season, currently lying in 10th place in the Süper Lig with nine points from their first seven games.

Their opponents come into this game in somewhat more disappointing form, having only managed four points from as many matches so far this season.

Manager Paul Le Guen will be looking for his team to build on their recent 1-0 victory over relegation strugglers Kayseri Erciyesspor and put together a good run of results which will see them move up the table.

One man who could well play a big role in proceedings is new signing Fernandao. The Brazilian striker has already shown he has what it takes to find the back of the net by scoring five goals in his first seven appearances for the club.

If Fernandao can continue his good form and add to his tally against Antalyaspor, it could well be enough to seal all three points for Bursaspor.
