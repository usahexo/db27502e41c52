#  Charles Leclerc Banned from Monte Carlo Casino Fruit Burst Game

Charles Leclerc has had his casino privileges revoked by the Monte Carlo Casino management after he was caught cheating at the Fruit Burst game. The 21-year-old Monegasque driver was caught on camera using a device to manipulate the game in his favour.

The casino issued a statement saying that "Mr. Leclerc is not welcome at the Monte Carlo Casino any longer. He is banned from entering the premises and playing any of our games."

Leclerc has since apologised for his actions, stating that he "made a mistake and I accept the consequences. I regret what I did and I apologise to the casino and to all my fans." He also announced that he will be taking some time away from racing to reflect on his mistake.

Leclerc's team, Ferrari, have also issued a statement supporting their driver. "Ferrari fully supports Charles Leclerc in this situation and we are sorry for what happened. We are working with him to ensure that this does not happen again."

This is not the first time Leclerc has been involved in controversy. In September 2017, he was banned from participating in Formula 2 races for two races after he deliberately crashed into another car while under pressure from his rival.

#  Charles Leclerc Banned from Monte Carlo Casino for Gambling

21-year-old Formula One driver Charles Leclerc has been banned from Monaco’s Monte Carlo Casino after being caught gambling illegally in the premises.

Leclerc was playing blackjack in the casino when he was caught by security staff, who then alerted the authorities. As a result, Leclerc was banned from all casinos in Monaco for six months.

This is not Leclerc’s first offence, as he was also caught gambling in a casino in Paris last year. On that occasion, he was given a warning and told to leave the premises.

Following his latest misdemeanour, Leclerc released a statement apologising for his actions. He said: “I am aware that I broke the law and I apologise for that. I will accept the consequences of my actions and will learn from this mistake.”

With Formula One returning to Monaco this weekend, it is likely that Leclerc will receive a lot of criticism from the fans and the media for his behaviour. In light of this, he will need to work hard to regain their trust and respect.
