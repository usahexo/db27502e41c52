#  Lightning Strikes Twice at Casino – Second Time in as Many Days!

A casino in Reno, Nevada had a surprise visit from Mother Nature over the weekend when lightning struck twice in as many days.

The first strike came on Saturday afternoon and caused a small fire that was quickly extinguished. There were no reported injuries.

But the drama wasn't over yet.

Just 24 hours later, another bolt of lightning struck the building – this time causing a power outage that impacted the entire casino.

Officials are still trying to determine the cause of the second strike, but say it's possible that it was related to Saturday's fire.

The good news is that both incidents were relatively minor and did not result in any serious damage or injuries.

Still, it's an unexpected and unwelcome surprise for the casino – and one that they're no doubt hoping never happens again!

#  Luck of the Irish? Casino Hit by Lightning for Second Time This Week!

In a stroke of bad luck, the same casino in Ireland was hit by lightning for the second time this week!

Smoke could be seen billowing from the building as emergency services arrived on the scene. It’s not yet known if there were any injuries or how much damage has been done.

This is the second such incident to affect the casino in recent weeks. In late January, it was also hit by a bolt of lightning, causing a fire that destroyed several gaming machines.

The casino is believed to have been struck by lightning on no fewer than six occasions in total over the past few years. Each time, it has resulted in significant damage and losses for the business.

Industry experts have attributed the spate of bad luck to the “luck of the Irish”. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that the casino might want to consider changing its name!

#  Is lightning striking twice at this casino?

The Thunderbolt Casino is one of the newest casinos in the area, and it’s quickly gaining a reputation for being a lucky spot. In just the past few months, two huge jackpots have been won there – one for over $1.7 million, and another for more than $2.4 million.

People are starting to wonder if lightning is striking twice at this casino, and whether or not it might be worth giving it a try. Some are even saying that this place is cursed, because who can be that lucky twice in such a short period of time?

Others are convinced that it’s just a coincidence, and that the odds of lightning striking twice at any given casino are astronomically low. After all, there are thousands of casinos around the world, so the likelihood of two major payouts happening at the same one is pretty slim.

But then again, stranger things have happened. So if you’re feeling lucky, maybe you should head on down to the Thunderbolt Casino and see if Lady Luck is on your side.

#  Lightning strike at casino causes power outage

At approximately 11:00 p.m. on Saturday, January 12th, a lightning strike at the Ameristar Casino in East St. Louis caused a power outage that affected much of the city. The outage lasted for more than two hours, leaving many people stranded in the casino and in other businesses without power.

The lightning strike reportedly occurred near the casino's electrical substation, causing a fire that took out power to the entire complex. City officials said that it may take several days to determine the extent of the damage and to make the necessary repairs.

In the meantime, business owners and residents are frustrated by the lack of communication from the casino or from Ameren Illinois, the company responsible for restoring power. Many people were stuck in elevators or inside buildings with no way to leave until emergency responders arrived.

"I was just about to go home," said one woman who had been stuck in an elevator for more than an hour. "I don't know what I'm going to do now."

Others expressed anger at being left in the dark without any information about when power would be restored. "This is ridiculous," said one man who had been waiting outside a business without power. "We can't even charge our phones."

City officials urged people to stay away from downtown East St. Louis until further notice.
