#  Sbotop Plays Criss Cross Poker – Dealt 5 Palms Before Shuffle!

This is going to be a quick and dirty overview of how Sbotop was able to achieve a royal flush in Criss Cross Poker before the shuffle even took place!

First, let's quickly discuss the game itself. Criss Cross Poker is a relatively simple 4-player poker variant where each player is dealt 5 cards face down. After all players have seen their cards, the dealer flips over the top card of the deck – this is called the turn card. The player with the best hand at this point (based on traditional poker rankings) starts the betting round.

After the initial betting round, the dealer flips over another card – this is called the river card. This is followed by a final betting round, and then all players reveal their hands. The player with the best 5-card poker hand wins the pot.

Now, let's take a look at how Sbotop was able to pull off the amazing feat! Hand #1: Sbotop was dealt 2♣ 3♥ 4♥ 5♦ 6♣. Since this is not a royal flush, Sbotop simply folded his hand and waited for the next deal.

Hand #2: Sbotop was dealt A♦ K♦ Q♦ J♠ 10♥. Once again, this is not a royal flush so Sbotop folded his hand and waited for the next deal.

Hand #3: Sbotop was dealt 2♦ 3♦ 4♦ 5♦ 6♥. This time, Sbotop held onto his hand and awaited further developments.

Hand #4: Sbotop was dealt A♥ K♥ Q♥ J♣ 10♠. Now things were starting to get interesting! This hand contains 2 pairs (Aces and Tens) as well as a potential straight (5 through King). Because of this, Sbotop decided to bet big on this hand during the final betting round in order to force any potential opponents out of the game. Sure enough, his hunch paid off and he ended up winning the pot uncontested!

Hand #5: Finally, we come to hand #5 – which would end up being the royal flush that gave Sbotop victory! He was dealt 2♠ 3♠ 4♣ 5♠ 6♠ which turned out to be a royal flush when matched with the turn and river cards (7♣ 8♥).

The preflop action is standard for a 3-bet pot with Sbotop in the big blind and bob on the button. Sbotop re-raises to 11,000 chips and bob moves all-in for 41,000 chips. At this point, Sbotop has two options: call and risk losing the pot or fold and give up the initiative. He decides to call and see the flop. The flop comes K♣9♣2♥ giving bobby two pair, Kings and deuces. The turn is the 6♦ and river is the 3♥ completing bobby's full house, Kings over deuces.

Sbotop's Criss Cross play was what got him into this hand in the first place and it nearly paid off! This pattern can work well in poker when you are playing against tight regulars who are more likely to fold their weaker hands preflop. By reraising preflop, you are putting pressure on your opponents to make a tough decision - whether to call or fold with an inferior hand. If they do call, you can often times find yourself in a great spot postflop since you have position and many cards left to come that could improve your hand.

#  Sbotop's Incredible Skill at Criss Cross Poker – 5 Deals in a Row!

It was a warm and muggy day, and I was in Central Park playing some criss cross poker with my buddies. We were all hot and sweaty, and the cards were getting sticky. But the action was intense, and no one wanted to give up.

I had been dealt three aces, but I was worried that someone might have something even better. So I decided to fold, and wait for a better opportunity.

Suddenly, SBOTOP (that's me) hit four straight deals in a row! My buddies were amazed – no one had ever seen anything like it!

In fact, some of them were so shocked that they actually folded their hands, even though they had good cards!

I guess you could say that I am pretty good at criss cross poker…
