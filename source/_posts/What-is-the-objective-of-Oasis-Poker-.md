#  What is the objective of Oasis Poker? 

The main objective of Oasis Poker is to provide players with a fun and engaging experience through its innovative gameplay mechanics. Additionally, the game also aims to provide players with opportunities to win generous payouts, making it a lucrative option for those looking to enjoy some casino excitement. 

# How Does Oasis Poker Work? 

Oasis Poker is played with a deck of 52 cards. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by accumulating a hand value that is higher than the dealer’s hand, without going over 21. Players are initially dealt two cards and can choose to either hold onto these cards or discard them in exchange for new ones from the deck. After discarding, players are then dealt one more card for their hand. 

The player’s goal is to make the best five-card poker hand possible using either the two original cards and three new ones, or the two original cards and one replacement card from the deck. The rank of hands starts with 2 pairs being the lowest ranking hand and ends with a Royal Flush being the highest ranking hand. In order to win, the player must beat the dealer’s hand, regardless of whether it is higher or lower than their own. If both hands are equal, then it is a push and neither player wins nor loses money. 

# What Are Some of The Unique Features of Oasis Poker? 

One unique feature of Oasis Poker is that players have an opportunity to improve their hand even after they have discarded their first two cards. This provides players with more flexibility in terms of how they want to play their hand, and can lead to some very lucrative payouts if executed correctly. 


Additionally, Oasis Poker features a betting system that allows players to wager up to 5x their ante bet on each round of play. This increases the excitement and adrenaline rush that comes with playing this variant of poker, as there is always something on the line no matter what stage of the game you are currently playing in!
