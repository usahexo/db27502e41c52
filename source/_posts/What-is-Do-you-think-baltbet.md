Do you think baltbet is a scam?

There are certainly some red flags that suggest this might be the case. For one, the company has no physical address listed on its website. Additionally, there is very little information available about who owns or operates the site.

However, it's also important to keep in mind that there is no definitive proof that baltbet is a scam. There are some positive reviews from customers who have supposedly been able to withdraw their winnings without any problems.

At this point, it's difficult to say for certain whether or not baltbet is legit. My advice would be to proceed with caution and do your own research before depositing any money into your account.
