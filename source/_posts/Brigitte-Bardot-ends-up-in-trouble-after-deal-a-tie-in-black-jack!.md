#  Brigitte Bardot ends up in trouble after deal a tie in black jack!

Brigitte Bardot, the actress who became famous in the 1950s for her sex appeal, was recently in hot water after being caught cheating at black jack. The incident took place at a casino in Saint-Tropez, where Bardot was enjoying a game of black jack with some friends.

Things were going well for Bardot and her group until she made a deal with the dealer that ended up costing her dearly. She apparently agreed to tie the game if the dealer would give her an extra card. Unfortunately for Bardot, the next card she received was an ace, which gave her partner a winning hand.

The casino security officials were notified of the incident and they quickly asked Bardot to leave. She was also banned from returning to the casino in the future. This is not the first time that Bardot has been involved in controversy. In 1992, she was fined for inciting racial hatred after making anti-Muslim remarks.

#  Black jack gone wrong for Brigitte Bardot!

One sunny day in Saint-Tropez, Brigitte Bardot was out playing blackjack with some friends. She was feeling lucky and managed to get up to around 1,000 francs. However, things started to go wrong and she began to lose money fast.

In a desperate attempt to win back her money, Bardot started doubling down on her bets - even when she had bad hands. Finally, she lost all her money and was left feeling humiliated.

This incident was made into a movie called "Brigitte Bardot et ses amis au casino" (Brigitte Bardot and her friends at the casino), which was released in 1964.

#  Brigitte Bardot dealt a tie in black jack - what happens next?

Brigitte Bardot, 83, one of France's most renowned actresses, was playing black jack at aboard the superyacht of rap mogul Stass Klassen when she dealt herself a tie.

She was one of six passengers on the vessel cruising off Corsica on Friday when the game unfolded. Klassen, 41, who is worth an estimated $800 million, live-streamed the scene on Instagram.

Bardot didn't seem phased by the turn of events and joked: "I've never won anything in my life."

So what happens next in this high stakes game?

If both players have the same total - in this case 21 - it is called a "push" and no money changes hands. In some casinos, players can choose to re-double their bet if they want to continue playing or they can collect their chips and leave the table.

When both players have 21, it's also a push but generally regarded as a rarer occurrence. The chances of both players having 21 are about 1 in 3300, according to Michael Shackleford, a gaming mathematician.

It's unclear what Bardot and Klassen decided to do but we can only imagine that the stakes got even higher after that pivotal hand!

#  Brigitte Bardot's unlucky day at the black jack table!

Legendary French actress Brigitte Bardot had an unlucky day at the black jack table in 1965. The starlet, who was enjoying a night out at the casino with her then-husband Jacques Charrier, reportedly lost â‚¬180,000 ($248,000) in just a few hours.

Bardot has always been open about her love of gambling, and has spoken about her experiences playing black jack and poker in the past. In a 1977 interview with Paris Match magazine, she said: "I like gambling because it's the only game where you can't cheat."

Interestingly, Bardot's losses at the black jack table weren't her only financial setback that year. The actress also lost a reported $1 million in a failed real estate venture. It seems that 1965 was not a good year for Brigitte Bardot financially!

In the exciting game of blackjack, one can only hope to achieve a tie. Surprisingly enough, when both the player and dealer have the same point value, what happens next is determined by the Brigitte Bardot card rule. Named after the famous actress and model, this rule dictates that if a player has a blackjack and the dealer does not (meaning their cards total 21), then the player automatically wins! Even more interesting, if both players achieve blackjacks, then it is a push and no one wins or loses money. So the next time you find yourself in a blackjack game, remember to keep an eye out for that Brigitte Bardot card- it just might mean the difference between victory and defeat!
