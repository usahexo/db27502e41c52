#  How Upgrade to DraftKings Location Enhances Sports Betting at ASVEL

Located near Lyon, France, ASVEL is a professional basketball team that’s gearing up for its fifth season in the country’s top-flight LNB Pro A league. The side is considered a major player in European basketball and boasts a passionate fanbase.

This year, though, ASVEL is making headlines for an entirely different reason: it has become the first French club to partner with DraftKings, the leading Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) company.

Starting from the opening game of the new season on September 29th, fans at the Palais des Sports Orena will be able to place bets on their preferred players directly from their smartphones. This partnership marks a huge move forward for sports betting in France and is sure to increase interest in both DFS and traditional sports betting alike.

So why has ASVEL teamed up with DraftKings? Well, there are several benefits for both parties involved.

For one, the partnership gives ASVEL access to some of the best DFS analytics in the world. By tracking player data such as minutes played, points scored and shooting percentage, DraftKings can help teams like ASVEL hone in on important factors that could influence match results. This information can then be used by ASVEL to help inform decisions around team selection and tactics – something that could be crucial in such a competitive league.

In addition, being associated with DraftKings provides added exposure for ASVEL both nationally and internationally. The company already has a strong presence in Europe and North America, so partnering with an established brand like DraftKings gives it a significant edge over its competitors. Fans of basketball – both casual and hardcore – are bound to take notice of ASVEL now that it has teamed up with one of the biggest names in DFS.

On the other hand, DraftKings gains access to a massive new audience through this partnership. The company is no stranger to success but partnering with a team as well-known as ASVEL will only serve to bolster its reputation further. Plus, given that France is one of Europe’s biggest markets for sports betting, there’s plenty of potential for growth here.

Both parties stand to gain a great deal from this partnership and it will be interesting to see how things develop over time. In any case, it’s clear that this alliance represents a big step forward for sports betting in France – and possibly beyond.

#  DraftKings Adds New Features for Sports Bettors at ASVEL

#

Last week, DraftKings announced a slate of new features for its sports bettors. The changes include a new "quick join" feature that allows users to enter contests with just two taps on their phone, as well as enhancements to the company's contest lobby and scoring interface.

According to the company, these updates are designed to make it easier for users to find and join contests, as well as keep track of their progress during games. As part of the rollout, DraftKings is also adding a new leaderboard that displays the top 10 players in each contest category.

The update is the latest effort by DraftKings to stay ahead of its competitors in what has become a crowded field. In recent months, both FanDuel and Yahoo have announced plans to roll out their own standalone sports betting platforms.

It will be interesting to see how the updated app compares to those offerings, and whether it will be enough to help DraftKings maintain its lead in the space.
