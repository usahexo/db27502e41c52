        <h1 id="Japanese-Slot-Machine-Maker-Plans-to-Sell-Product-in-the-United-States"><a href="#Japanese-Slot-Machine-Maker-Plans-to-Sell-Product-in-the-United-States" class="headerlink" title="Japanese Slot Machine Maker Plans to Sell Product in the United States"></a>Japanese Slot Machine Maker Plans to Sell Product in the United States</h1><p>A leading Japanese slot machine maker has announced its plans to sell its products in the United States. The news comes as a surprise, as the company has been known for shunning foreign markets in the past.</p>
<p>The company, which has remained unnamed, is Japan’s third largest slot machine maker. It announced its intentions to begin sales operations in the United States by the end of this year. The move is likely in response to President Trump’s efforts to promote and revive the American manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>Numerous American gaming companies are said to have already shown interest in the Japanese firm’s products. These companies are likely attracted by the high-quality and efficiency of the Japanese machines. The products are also likely to be competitively priced, as labor costs in Japan are much higher than in China.</p>
<p>This would not be the first time a Japanese manufacturer has attempted to sell its products in the United States. However, most such attempts have been unsuccessful, as American manufacturers have been able to compete using cheaper labor costs. It will be interesting to see if this new player can make a dent in what has been a largely monopolized market.</p>
<h1 id="Slot-Machine-Maker-Goes-Overseas"><a href="#Slot-Machine-Maker-Goes-Overseas" class="headerlink" title="Slot Machine Maker Goes Overseas"></a>Slot Machine Maker Goes Overseas</h1><p>As the industry of slot machines has begun to saturate in the United States, one of the leading manufacturers has looked to expand overseas. The company, which has declined to be identified, is reported to be in the final stages of negotiations for a manufacturing plant in Macau.</p>
<p>The move is said to be in response to increased competition at home and an evolving global market. Slot machine sales have been slowing in the U.S., while they continue to grow in other parts of the world, such as Asia.</p>
<p>Macau has become a popular destination for casino-goers, with over $38 billion being wagered there in 2016. That’s more than twice what was bet in Las Vegas. The new plant would put the slot machine maker in a strong position to capitalize on that growth.</p>
<p>It’s not yet clear how many jobs will be created by the new plant or what it will mean for the company’s domestic workforce. However, it seems likely that some production will be shifted away from the U.S. and that some employees will lose their jobs as a result.</p>
<h1 id="Japan-Slot-Machine-Makers-Eye-Foreign-Markets"><a href="#Japan-Slot-Machine-Makers-Eye-Foreign-Markets" class="headerlink" title="Japan Slot Machine Makers Eye Foreign Markets"></a>Japan Slot Machine Makers Eye Foreign Markets</h1><p>The Japanese slot machine market is growing, but it is starting to become saturated. As a result, the country’s leading slot machine makers are looking to expand into other countries.</p>
<p>For companies like Konami and Intralot, this means targeting foreign markets with their products. In particular, they are looking to make inroads into Southeast Asia, which is seen as a region with high potential for growth.</p>
<p>One reason for this is that the region has a large population and growing economy. In addition, there is a lack of well-developed gambling infrastructure in many countries in the region. This provides an opportunity for companies like Konami and Intralot to establish themselves as leaders in the market.</p>
<p>To date, both companies have been successful in making inroads into the region. Konami has established a strong presence in Thailand, while Intralot has been successful in Malaysia. They are both now looking to expand further into other countries in the region.</p>
<h1 id="Slot-Machine-Makers-Expanding-Overseas-Sales-Operation"><a href="#Slot-Machine-Makers-Expanding-Overseas-Sales-Operation" class="headerlink" title="Slot Machine Makers Expanding Overseas Sales Operation"></a>Slot Machine Makers Expanding Overseas Sales Operation</h1><p>Slot machine makers are expanding their overseas sales operations to tap into new markets as growth in their home markets stagnates. </p>
<p>According to market research firm Euromonitor International, global slot machine sales are forecast to grow from $40.3 billion in 2017 to $44.8 billion by 2021. The firm said the Asia-Pacific region is the fastest-growing market for slot machines, with sales forecast to grow from $8.9 billion in 2017 to $11.5 billion by 2021. </p>
<p>To capitalize on this growth, slot machine makers are beefing up their sales operations in the region. For example, Las Vegas-based Aristocrat Leisure Ltd., one of the world’s largest slot machine makers, has set up a subsidiary in Singapore and plans to open an office in South Korea this year. It also plans to increase its staff in China by about 50 percent this year. </p>
<p>Similarly, International Game Technology (IGT), another large slot machine maker, has been expanding its sales team in the Asia-Pacific region. IGT’s president for Asia Pacific, Charles Lovejoy, said in a recent interview that the company is seeing strong demand for its products in countries such as Thailand and Vietnam. </p>
<p>The move by slot machine makers to expand their overseas sales operations comes as growth in their home markets slows down. Gambling revenue growth in the United States has slowed from a high of 14 percent in 2012 to 2 percent last year, according to research firm H2 Gambling Capital. This is due largely to regulatory changes that have made it more difficult for casinos to open new slots machines. </p>
<p>In contrast, gambling revenues continue to grow rapidly in Asia Pacific countries such as Macau and Singapore. For example, Macau’s gambling revenues increased by 19 percent last year, while Singapore’s grew by 8 percent. This provides a strong incentive for slot machine makers to focus more attention on these regions. </p>
<p> coupled with a slowdown at home - especially thanks regulatory hurdles - US based slot machine companies looks eastward As Aristocrat Leisure Ltd., sets up shop and International Game Technology expands rapidly there</p>
<h1 id="Japanese-Slot-Machine-Maker-to-Enter-U-S-Market"><a href="#Japanese-Slot-Machine-Maker-to-Enter-U-S-Market" class="headerlink" title="Japanese Slot Machine Maker to Enter U.S. Market"></a>Japanese Slot Machine Maker to Enter U.S. Market</h1><p>Japanese slot machine maker Konami Holdings Corporation plans to enter the U.S. market in 2020, seeking to tap into the growing demand for the gaming machines.</p>
<p>The company is currently finalizing its plans and expects to launch a “substantial” business in the United States, President and Chief Executive Officer Seiichi Sudo said at an earnings briefing Wednesday.</p>
<p>Konami Holdings Corporation anticipates solid profits from its new business, expecting steady growth especially in states that have legalized casino gambling. </p>
<p>The global market for casino games is forecast to grow from $52.9 billion in 2019 to $75.8 billion by 2025, according to research firm Allied Market Research. The U.S. market is expected to account for more than half of that increase. </p>
<p>Las Vegas-based Konami Gaming Inc., a subsidiary of Konami Holdings Corporation, supplies gaming machines to casinos across North America. The company is one of the world’s largest makers of slot machines. </p>
<p>Konami Holdings Corporation announced last year that it would sell off its video game unit and mobile phone operations, focusing on its core strengths in gaming and amusement machines.</p>
