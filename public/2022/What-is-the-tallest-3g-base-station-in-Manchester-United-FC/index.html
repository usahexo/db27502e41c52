The club was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club, and played its first competitive match in November 1886.</p>
<p>The Red Devils, as they are nicknamed, are one of the most popular and successful clubs in world football having won 62 trophies, including a record 20 league titles, 11 FA Cups and three UEFA Champions League titles.</p>
<p>Manchester United FC play their home matches at Old Trafford in Manchester. The stadium has a capacity of 75,731 and was originally built in 1910. It has been expanded on numerous occasions and is currently the largest club stadium in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Old Trafford is also home to the Manchester United FC Museum and Tour Centre, which welcomes around one million visitors each year. The museum displays a collection of over 200 items from the club’s history, including shirts worn by some of its greatest players, trophies and memorabilia from important fixtures.</p>
<p>The tour centre offers fans the chance to experience what it’s like to be a Manchester United player or manager for a day. Visitors can take part in a number of challenges such as taking penalties against a goalkeeper or completing passing drills.</p>
<p>In addition to Old Trafford, Manchester United FC also has training facilities at Carrington and Aon Complex. The Aon Complex is located close to the city centre and comprises two indoor pitches, eight outdoor pitches (six grass pitches and two artificial surfaces) as well as accommodation and office space for the first team squad and staff.</p>
<p>Manchester United FC is clearly a popular club with plenty to offer its supporters. But what about its telecommunications infrastructure? What is the tallest 3g base station in Manchester United FC?</p>
<p>Manchester United FC doesn’t have just one 3g base station; it has several! In fact, Manchester United FC has more 3g base stations than any other club in the world! And while we can’t say for sure which one is the tallest, we can narrow it down to a few contenders.</p>
<p>One possible contender is the 3g base station that’s located at Old Trafford itself. Old Trafford is the largest club stadium in the United Kingdom with a capacity of 75,731 spectators, so it’s likely that this base station covers a large area. It’s also worth noting that this base station went live back in 2011 – just ahead of the start of the 2011-12 Premier League season – so it’s likely that it’s one of Manchester United FC’s most modern installations.</p>
<p>Another contender could be the 3g base station that’s located at Carrington – Manchester United FC’s training ground. Carrington is much smaller than Old Trafford with a capacity of just 400 spectators, but it still offers good coverage for 3g services. Plus, given that this base station went live way back in 2009 – mere months after Manchester United FC won their 18th league title – it could well be one of their oldest installations!</p>
