The $360 million deal includes the casino, hotel, and spa resort as well as other associated amenities.</p>
<p>“Lake Charles is an excellent strategic fit for our company,” said the owner of Treasure Palace, who asked to remain anonymous. “It’s a growing market with a lot of potential, and we’re excited to be able to bring our world-class gaming and resort experience to Louisiana.”</p>
<p>L’Auberge Casino Resort is a 1,000-acre property that features 362 rooms and suites, as well as 68,000 square feet of casino space with more than 1,500 slot machines and 36 table games. It also includes a full-service spa, five restaurants, and a variety of entertainment options.</p>
<p>The acquisition is expected to close in January 2019.</p>
<h1 id="New-Owner-of-L’Auberge-Casino-Resort-Announced"><a href="#New-Owner-of-L’Auberge-Casino-Resort-Announced" class="headerlink" title="New Owner of L’Auberge Casino Resort Announced"></a>New Owner of L’Auberge Casino Resort Announced</h1><p>The new owner of L’Auberge Casino Resort has been announced. JF Dongarra, a business mogul from Dallas, Texas, has bought the casino and resort for an undisclosed amount.</p>
<p>Dongarra is the founder and CEO of JFD Group, a holding company with business interests in real estate, hospitality, oil and gas production, and more. He is also the owner of the Omni Hotel in downtown Dallas.</p>
<p>L’Auberge Casino Resort is a major employer in the Baton Rouge area and is one of the most popular destinations in Louisiana for tourists. The casino features over 1,500 slot machines and gaming tables, as well as a variety of restaurants and bars. It also features a large hotel with over 500 rooms.</p>
<p>“I am excited to be the new owner of L’Auberge Casino Resort,” said Dongarra in a statement. “This is a world-class property and I am committed to making it even better.”</p>
<p>Dongarra did not give any specifics about his plans for the casino and resort, but said that he was looking forward to working with the local community and creating jobs. He also praised the hardworking employees at L’Auberge and said that they would be a top priority for him.</p>
<p>Local officials welcomed the news of Dongarra’s purchase. “We are excited to have Mr. Dongarra as our new partner,” said Mayor Sharon Weston Broome. “He brings a wealth of experience in the hospitality industry and we look forward to working with him to continue to make L’Auberge one of the top destinations in Louisiana.”</p>
<h1 id="Billionaire-Investor-Purchases-L’Auberge-Casino-Resort"><a href="#Billionaire-Investor-Purchases-L’Auberge-Casino-Resort" class="headerlink" title="Billionaire Investor Purchases L’Auberge Casino Resort"></a>Billionaire Investor Purchases L’Auberge Casino Resort</h1><p>Billionaire investor Carl Icahn has agreed to purchase L’Auberge Casino Resort in Baton Rouge, Louisiana from Pinnacle Entertainment for $616 million.</p>
<p>L’Auberge Casino Resort is a AAA Four Diamond resort that features 122,000 square feet of casino gaming space, including 1,600 slot machines and 90 table games. The property also features a 54-room hotel, spa, and several restaurants.</p>
<p>The acquisition of L’Auberge Casino Resort marks Icahn’s entry into the Louisiana gambling market. In a statement announcing the deal, Icahn said he was “excited to have the opportunity to own and operate a top-notch casino resort in Baton Rouge.”</p>
<p>Pinnacle Entertainment had been seeking a buyer for L’Auberge Casino Resort since last year, when the company put itself up for sale. In November 2017, Pinnacle reached an agreement to sell the property to Eldorado Resorts for $873 million, but the deal fell through in February 2018.</p>
<p>Icahn is no stranger to the casino industry. The 80-year-old investor is currently the largest shareholder of Tropicana Entertainment, which owns and operates nine casinos and resorts in the United States.</p>
<h1 id="Renowned-Casino-Resort-Sold-to-Unknown-Investor"><a href="#Renowned-Casino-Resort-Sold-to-Unknown-Investor" class="headerlink" title="Renowned Casino Resort Sold to Unknown Investor"></a>Renowned Casino Resort Sold to Unknown Investor</h1><p>The world-renowned casino resort known as “The Strip” has been sold to an unknown investor for an undisclosed amount of money. The new owner is said to be a reclusive businessperson who has never been involved in the casino industry before.</p>
<p>This news has come as a shock to many employees and guests of the establishment, as the new owner has made no indication that he plans to change anything about the resort. In a statement, the reclusive investor said only that he is “very excited about this new venture” and hopes to “make Las Vegas even more famous than it already is.”</p>
<p>When asked for comment, employees of the casino resort were tight-lipped, saying only that they are “waiting to see what happens next.” Regular guests of the casino were also reluctant to speak on the record, but all seemed to agree that the sale was something of a surprise.</p>
<p>The Strip has been a fixture of Las Vegas since its construction in 1971. It was originally built by Howard Hughes and has had several different owners over the years. The resort is known for its luxurious accommodations, including several high-end restaurants and a world-class spa.</p>
<h1 id="Mystery-Investor-Buys-Louisiana’s-L’Auberge-Casino-Resort"><a href="#Mystery-Investor-Buys-Louisiana’s-L’Auberge-Casino-Resort" class="headerlink" title="Mystery Investor Buys Louisiana’s L’Auberge Casino Resort"></a>Mystery Investor Buys Louisiana’s L’Auberge Casino Resort</h1><p>The future of Louisiana’s L’Auberge Casino Resort is now in the hands of a mystery investor.</p>
<p>On Monday, it was announced that the casino had been sold to an unidentified individual for an undisclosed sum. This comes after a long and difficult process to find a buyer for the property.</p>
<p>L’Auberge Casino Resort has been operational since 2012 and was one of the first major gambling establishments to open in the state. It features a 300-room hotel, a 30,000-square-foot gaming floor, and several restaurants.</p>
<p>However, it has faced significant financial difficulties in recent years. In 2017, its parent company declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This led to the casino being put up for sale later that year.</p>
<p>The identity of the new owner has not been released, but they are expected to keep the property running as is. Representatives from L’Auberge Casino Resort have declined to comment on the sale.</p>
