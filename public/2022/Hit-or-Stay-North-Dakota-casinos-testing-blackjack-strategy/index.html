North Dakota casinos testing blackjack strategy"></a>Hit or Stay? North Dakota casinos testing blackjack strategy</h1><p>Some casinos in North Dakota are testing a new blackjack strategy that could have players hitting or standing depending on their cards.</p>
<p>The strategy, called DAS (Double At Stand), is being tested at the Spirit Lake Casino and the Prairie Knights Casino Resort. Both casinos are owned and operated by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.</p>
<p>According to reports, the new strategy has been met with mixed results so far. Some players are winning more hands, while others are losing more money.</p>
<p>The general idea behind the DAS strategy is that players should hit if they have a score of 16 or less, and stand if they have a score of 17 or more. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, players should always hit if they have an Ace and a 6 (or any other combination that totals up to 17).</p>
<p>The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe says that it developed the DAS strategy in order to give players a better chance of winning. But casino officials say that they may ditch the strategy if it proves to be unsuccessful.</p>
<h1 id="North-Dakota-loosens-blackjack-rules-to-attract-players"><a href="#North-Dakota-loosens-blackjack-rules-to-attract-players" class="headerlink" title="North Dakota loosens blackjack rules to attract players"></a>North Dakota loosens blackjack rules to attract players</h1><p>In an effort to attract more players to its casinos, North Dakota has decided to loosen its blackjack rules.</p>
<p>The new rules mean that players will now be able to split their hands up to four times, and can also double down on any two cards.</p>
<p>Casino operators in the state say that they are hopeful the new rules will help to boost casino revenues, which have been in decline in recent years.</p>
<p>North Dakota is not the only state to change its blackjack rules in an attempt to attract players; neighboring Minnesota has also made some changes to its rules in recent months.</p>
<p>While loosening the rules may help to attract some players, it is likely that most serious blackjack players will continue to stick with casinos that offer better odds.</p>
<h1 id="Stay-the-new-key-to-winning-at-blackjack-in-North-Dakota"><a href="#Stay-the-new-key-to-winning-at-blackjack-in-North-Dakota" class="headerlink" title="Stay the new key to winning at blackjack in North Dakota?"></a>Stay the new key to winning at blackjack in North Dakota?</h1><p>Most blackjack enthusiasts know by now that card counting can give players a significant advantage against the casino. But even with perfect execution, there’s always the risk of being caught and booted from the game. So what’s a savvy player to do?</p>
<p>Stay the new key to winning at blackjack in North Dakota according to recent studies. Casinos are increasingly using automatic card shufflers that randomize the order of the cards, making traditional card counting techniques useless. However, by using Stay systems instead, you can still beat the house without all the risk. Stay systems keep track of specific aspects of the game including when dealers bust, how many Aces have been played, and more. With this information, players can make informed decisions about when and how to bet that give them an edge over the house.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a new way to take on blackjack, be sure to give Stay systems a try. You may be surprised at just how profitable they can be!</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-players-split-on-when-to-hit-or-stay-in-North-Dakota"><a href="#Blackjack-players-split-on-when-to-hit-or-stay-in-North-Dakota" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack players split on when to hit or stay in North Dakota"></a>Blackjack players split on when to hit or stay in North Dakota</h1><p>DICKINSON, N.D. - Since legalized gambling arrived in North Dakota a decade ago, blackjack has been the most popular table game in the state.</p>
<p>Now, some players are divided on when to hit or stay in the game.</p>
<p>The decision whether to hit or stay is based on the player’s hand and the dealer’s up card. When the dealer’s up card is between two and six, players should hit if they have 16 or less points and stand if they have 17 or more points.</p>
<p>If the dealer’s up card is a seven or higher, players should always hit if they have 16 or less points.</p>
<p>But some North Dakota blackjack players say they’re not sure what to do when they have a hard total of 11. Should they hit against a 2 or 3 up card? Stay against a 4, 5 or 6? The answer depends on what you’re hoping to get out of the hand.</p>
<p>“I usually hit against a 2 or 3 and stand against anything else,” said blackjack player Barb Kappelman of Dickinson. “But I’ve had people tell me that I’m wrong.”</p>
<p>Kappelman said she learned how to play blackjack from her father, who taught her to always hit against a 2 or 3 up card and always stand against anything else. But some experts advise that players should double down against a 2 or 3 up card and hit against a 4, 5 or 6.</p>
<p>“Doubling down is definitely the better play against a 2 or 3,” said blackjack expert Henry Tamburin of Casino Player magazine. “But if you’re not comfortable doing that, then hitting is better than standing.”</p>

According to the report, blackjack bettors are hitting and staying more often than other players, leading to increased profits for casinos statewide.</p>
<p>The study looked at data from the past three years, and found that blackjack players have a success rate of just over 50%, meaning they’re hitting and staying more often than players in other games. This has led to an increase in casino profits of nearly 10%.</p>
<p>Blackjack has long been one of the most popular casino games, and it seems that this trend is only increasing. In North Dakota, at least, it would appear that the best way to beat the house is to play blackjack.</p>
