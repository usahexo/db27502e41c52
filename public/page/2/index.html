        <h1 id="How-Insurance-Policies-are-Like-Gambling-in-Las-Vegas-Casino"><a href="#How-Insurance-Policies-are-Like-Gambling-in-Las-Vegas-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How Insurance Policies are Like Gambling in Las Vegas Casino"></a>How Insurance Policies are Like Gambling in Las Vegas Casino</h1><p>Las Vegas is a place where people can enjoy a variety of activities, including gambling. When most people think of Las Vegas, they think of the casinos. The casinos are what make Las Vegas so popular. People can gamble on different games such as blackjack, roulette, and poker.</p>
<p>One similarity between insurance policies and gambling in Las Vegas casinos is that both are a gamble. With insurance policies, you are gambling that something bad will happen to you. With gambling in Las Vegas casinos, you are gambling that you will win more than you lose.</p>
<p>Another similarity between the two is that both can be addictive. Some people get addicted to the thrill of gambling in Las Vegas casinos. They can’t stop themselves from going back time and time again. The same is true for some people with insurance policies. They get addicted to the thrill of knowing that something bad could happen at any moment.</p>
<p>A final similarity between insurance policies and gambling in Las Vegas casinos is that both can be expensive. Gambling in Las Vegas casinos can be expensive if you lose money. Insurance policies can also be expensive if you have to pay a lot of money for coverage.</p>
<h1 id="The-similarities-between-insurance-policies-and-gambling-in-Las-Vegas-Casino"><a href="#The-similarities-between-insurance-policies-and-gambling-in-Las-Vegas-Casino" class="headerlink" title="The similarities between insurance policies and gambling in Las Vegas Casino"></a>The similarities between insurance policies and gambling in Las Vegas Casino</h1><p>There are a few similarities between taking out an insurance policy and gambling in a casino. The first similarity is that both activities have the potential to result in a financial loss. This risk is one of the reasons why many people choose not to get insurance or gamble.</p>
<p>Another similarity between insurance policies and gambling is that there is always the potential for something unusual to happen. In Las Vegas, for example, it is possible to hit the jackpot on any spin of the roulette wheel. Similarly, an insurance policy can pay out a large sum of money if something unusual happens, such as a car accident or house fire.</p>
<p>There is also a lot of chance involved in both activities. While some people may see this as a negative, others find it exciting and thrilling. In the same way, some people enjoy taking risks when they gamble, while others are more cautious.</p>
<p>Finally, both activities can be addictive. This means that some people can find it hard to stop gambling or taking out insurance policies once they have started.</p>
<h1 id="How-insurance-policies-are-similar-to-gambling-in-Las-Vegas-Casino"><a href="#How-insurance-policies-are-similar-to-gambling-in-Las-Vegas-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How insurance policies are similar to gambling in Las Vegas Casino"></a>How insurance policies are similar to gambling in Las Vegas Casino</h1><p>If you are like most people, when you think of gambling, the first place that comes to mind is Las Vegas. The glittering lights, the sounds of slot machines, and the endless buffets all make for a uniquely Sin City experience. But what you may not know is that gambling in Las Vegas is actually quite similar to buying insurance policies.</p>
<p>When you gamble in Las Vegas, you are essentially betting on something happening in the future. You may bet on the outcome of a game or on whether or not a certain number will come up on the roulette wheel. In either case, you are giving up something now in order to receive something later. If your bet pays off, then you receive a financial gain. If it doesn’t, then you lose what you put into the bet.</p>
<p>The same is true with insurance policies. When you purchase an insurance policy, you are betting that something bad will happen in the future. You may bet that your car will be stolen or that you will get sick and require expensive medical treatment. In either case, you are giving up something now (the premium payments) in order to receive something later (a financial payout if something bad happens).</p>
<p>But just like in Las Vegas, there is no guarantee that your bet will pay off. You may never have to make a claim on your car insurance policy, or your illness may not be as expensive as you anticipated. In this case, you would have wasted all of the money that you put into premiums over the years.</p>
<p>This is why it’s important to be careful when purchasing insurance policies. Just like with gambling in Las Vegas, there is always the risk that you will lose money in the long run. So before signing up for an insurance policy, be sure to read all of the small print and understand what exactly you are betting on.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-in-Las-Vegas-Casino-and-insurance-policies-What’s-the-difference"><a href="#Gambling-in-Las-Vegas-Casino-and-insurance-policies-What’s-the-difference" class="headerlink" title="Gambling in Las Vegas Casino and insurance policies: What’s the difference?"></a>Gambling in Las Vegas Casino and insurance policies: What’s the difference?</h1><p>When you hear the words “gambling” and “Las Vegas,” the first thing that probably comes to mind is casino games, such as blackjack, poker, and slots. In fact, most people erroneously believe that casino gambling is the only type of gambling allowed in Sin City.</p>
<p>However, there are other types of gambling available in Las Vegas, including lotteries, race tracks, and even bingo. And while casino gambling is the most popular type of gambling in Las Vegas, it’s far from the only one.</p>
<p>What many people don’t know is that there’s a big difference between casino gambling and insurance policies. In fact, most people would be surprised to learn that insurance policies are actually a type of gambling.</p>
<p>So what’s the difference? The main difference is that casino gambling is a game of chance, while insurance policies are a game of skill. With casino gambling, you’re basically betting on whether or not you’ll win or lose. With insurance policies, you’re betting on which side will have the better odds.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s always some element of chance with insurance policies, but the key difference is that you’re making a calculated bet based on the odds. With casino gambling, you’re simply betting on chance alone.</p>
<p>Another key difference between casino gambling and insurance policies is that with casino gambling, you’re risking your own money. With insurance policies, you’re risking someone else’s money. This is why insurance policies are often referred to as “decision gambles.”</p>
<p>So which is riskier? Casino gambling or insurance policies? It depends on who you ask. Some people would say that casino gambling is riskier because it’s easier to lose your money than it is to make a claim on an insurance policy. Others might say that insurance policies are riskier because they have less favorable odds than casino games do.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference. Some people enjoy the excitement and thrill of playing casino games, while others prefer the peace of mind that comes with having an insurance policy.</p>
<h1 id="Are-insurance-policies-like-gambling-in-Las-Vegas-Casino"><a href="#Are-insurance-policies-like-gambling-in-Las-Vegas-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Are insurance policies like gambling in Las Vegas Casino?"></a>Are insurance policies like gambling in Las Vegas Casino?</h1><p>Casinos in Las Vegas offer insurance policies on games such as roulette, blackjack, and craps. The policies are typically written for a percentage of the amount wagered, such as 10 percent. For example, if someone wagers $100 on a game of roulette and the policy pays out, the casino would pay out $110.</p>
<p>So, are insurance policies like gambling in Las Vegas casinos? In some ways, yes. Insurance policies and gambling both involve making a bet on an uncertain outcome. However, there are some important distinctions between these activities.</p>
<p>The main difference between insurance policies and gambling is that with insurance, you are betting against a known probability. For example, in the case of automobile insurance, you are betting that your car will be in an accident. The odds of this happening may be uncertain, but they are not random. With gambling, on the other hand, you are betting against unknown odds. This is what makes gambling riskier and potentially more profitable.</p>
<p>Another key distinction is that with insurance you can protect yourself against large losses. If your car is worth $10,000 and you have collision coverage of $5,000, your insurer will only pay out $5,000 if your car is damaged in an accident. With gambling, there is no such protection. If you lose your bet, you lose everything you wagered.</p>
<p>Insurance policies also tend to be cheaper than gambling. For example, auto insurance rates in most states range from about $50 to $200 per year, while the average gambler risks losing much more money than that per visit to a casino.</p>
<p>So are insurance policies like gambling in Las Vegas casinos? In some ways they are similar but there are important distinctions between the two activities that make them different overall</p>

        <h1 id="How-to-Start-a-Sports-Gaming-Business-from-Scratch"><a href="#How-to-Start-a-Sports-Gaming-Business-from-Scratch" class="headerlink" title="How to Start a Sports Gaming Business from Scratch"></a>How to Start a Sports Gaming Business from Scratch</h1><p>It is no secret that the sports industry is booming. Hundreds of billions of dollars are generated every year because of fans’ love for their favorite teams and sports. This passion creates opportunities for those looking to start a sports gaming business.</p>
<p>The great thing about this industry is that there is something for everyone. If you’re creative and have a knack for marketing, you could develop new games. If you’re more of a business person, you could manage an existing gaming business. Or, if you’re like me, you could do both!</p>
<p>In this article, I will share some tips on how to get started in the sports gaming industry. But first, let’s take a look at some of the basics.</p>
<p>What Is Sports Gaming?</p>
<p>Sports gaming involves playing or watching simulated versions of real-life sporting events. This can be done through video games, online platforms, or even betting markets.</p>
<p>The popularity of sports gaming has exploded in recent years. In 2017, the global sports gaming market was worth over $100 billion. And it is projected to grow at a rate of more than 10% annually over the next five years!</p>
<p>Why Is Sports Gaming So Popular?</p>
<p>There are plenty of reasons why sports gaming is so popular. Here are just a few:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Fans love to immerse themselves in the action. Whether they are playing or watching, gamers get a sense of satisfaction from participating in sport simulations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gamers can win big money by betting on sports games. This has created a large and growing betting market around the world. In fact, the global sports betting market is expected to be worth over $700 billion by 2025!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Video games are a great way to learn about new sports without having to leave home! This is especially true for kids who want to get into sport but don’t know where to start. Sports video games offer a fun and interactive way to learn about the rules and gameplay involved in different sporting disciplines.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Many professional athletes are avid gamers themselves! This gives gamers an opportunity to emulate their favorite athletes and try out their moves themselves. Some athletes even endorse specific video games or offer advice on how to improve one’s gameplay skills.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we know what sports gaming is and why it’s so popular, let’s look at how you can get started in this exciting industry!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Leverage-Your-Sports-Knowledge-to-Start-a-Sports-Gaming-Business"><a href="#How-to-Leverage-Your-Sports-Knowledge-to-Start-a-Sports-Gaming-Business" class="headerlink" title="How to Leverage Your Sports Knowledge to Start a Sports Gaming Business"></a>How to Leverage Your Sports Knowledge to Start a Sports Gaming Business</h1><p>There’s no doubt that the sports industry is booming. From the NFL to NBA, soccer to MLB, and just about everything in between; fans are flocking to sporting events and tuning in to watch their favorite athletes compete. This surge in popularity has not gone unnoticed by the business world, with sports gaming businesses popping up all over the place.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of sports and have some business acumen, then starting a sports gaming business might be the perfect venture for you. In this article, we’re going to outline some of the essential steps you need to take to get your business off the ground. So, whether you’re looking for a new opportunity or just want to gain a little more insight into this growing industry, read on!</p>
<p>Step 1: Choose Your Sport</p>
<p>The first step in starting your sports gaming business is choosing the sport or sports you want to focus on. This decision will be based on a variety of factors such as your personal interests and expertise, as well as market trends.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re interested in basketball but don’t know much about soccer, it might make more sense to focus on basketball-related games rather than attempting to create a soccer gaming platform. However, if you feel confident in your ability to appeal to both soccer and basketball fans alike, then go for it!</p>
<p>Step 2: Do Your Research</p>
<p>No matter what sport(s) you decide to focus on, it’s important to do your research before launching your business. This means studying the competitive landscape, learning about customer demographics and needs, and gathering intel on what types of games and platforms are available.</p>
<p>This information will help you determine which areas of the market you should focus on and how best to position yourself against existing competition. It will also give you a better understanding of what types of games and features customers are most likely to want and need.</p>
<p>Step 3: Create Your Business Plan</p>
<p>Once you have a good understanding of both the sports industry and the gaming industry as a whole, it’s time to create your business plan. This document will serve as your roadmap for launching and running your business. It should include detailed information about your company vision, mission statement, target markets, product offerings, marketing strategy, financial projections, and more.</p>
<p>Creating a well-informed business plan is critical for any new venture – doing so will help ensure that your business is headed in the right direction from day one.</p>

This can be a great way to get into the game and improve your skills, but there are some tips that can help you win more games.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Know the game inside and out. This may seem like an obvious one, but it’s important to know all the ins and outs of the game you’re playing. If you’re playing Madden, for example, know all the players and their stats; know the team’s playbook; know how to run each play. The same goes for any other sport – know the players, know the teams, know the plays.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Practice makes perfect. The more you play, the better you’ll become. This is especially true if you practice using different strategies – trying new things in a practice setting can help you when it comes to game time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Watch films of your opponents. If you can watch films of your opponents, do so; this will give you insight into their playing style and what plays they might use against you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use cheats sparingly (if at all). Some people swear by cheats as a way to win games; however, using cheats can also lead to defeats if your opponents figure them out. It’s generally best to save cheats for when you really need them – and only use them if they won’t give away your strategy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay calm under pressure. One of the biggest keys to winning is staying calm under pressure – something that can be tough to do, especially if things aren’t going your way. But keeping a level head is key, so try to take a deep breath and stay focused on what you need to do to win.</p>
</li>

Here’s How to Find Out"></a>Is Sports Gaming the Next Big Thing? Here’s How to Find Out</h1><p>Video gaming has been a part of our culture since the days of Pong and Pac-Man. But what about sports gaming? How popular is it, and is it growing?</p>
<p>If you’re curious about the popularity of sports gaming, there are a few ways to find out. One way is to look at the sales numbers for popular sports games. Another way is to look at the number of people who watch eSports tournaments online or in person.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at some of the most popular sports games and eSports tournaments to get an idea of how popular they are.</p>
<p>First, let’s take a look at the sales numbers for some popular sports games. According to VGChartz, the top five best-selling sports games between January 1 and May 31, 2018 were:</p>
<ol>
<li>FIFA 18</li>
<li>NBA 2K18</li>
<li>Mario Tennis Aces </li>
<li>MLB The Show 18 </li>
<li>Pro Evolution Soccer 2018</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s clear that FIFA 18 is one of the most popular sports games around, with NBA 2K18 coming in a close second. Other popular sports games include Madden NFL 19, NHL 19, and WWE 2K19. All these games have seen significant sales numbers in recent years.</p>
<p>But what about eSports? How popular are they compared to regular sporting events? Let’s take a look at some viewership numbers.</p>
<p>According to Newzoo, the largest Esports tournament in history was The International 2017 (held by Valve Corporation), which had over 23 million viewers online. That’s more than the Super Bowl! The League of Legends World Championship 2017 also had over 60 million viewers online, making it one of the most watched events in human history. These viewership numbers just go to show how popular eSports tournaments have become in recent years.</p>
<h1 id="The-Complete-Guide-to-Starting-a-Successful-Sports-Gaming-Business"><a href="#The-Complete-Guide-to-Starting-a-Successful-Sports-Gaming-Business" class="headerlink" title="The Complete Guide to Starting a Successful Sports Gaming Business"></a>The Complete Guide to Starting a Successful Sports Gaming Business</h1><p>Do you love sports? Do you love video games? Have you ever dreamt of starting your own sports gaming company? If so, this guide is for you!</p>
<p>In this guide, we will cover everything you need to know about starting a sports gaming business. We will discuss the business model, the key components of a successful business, the challenges you will face, and more. So whether you are just starting out or have been in business for a while, this guide will provide you with everything you need to know to make your sports gaming business a success.</p>
<p>Let’s get started!</p>
<p>The Business Model</p>
<p>There are three main business models for sports gaming businesses: online subscription, pay-per-game&#x2F;event, and advertising.</p>
<p>Online subscription is the most popular model, where users pay a monthly or annual fee to access a library of games. Pay-per-game&#x2F;event is where users pay for each game or event that they want to play. Advertising is where companies pay to have their products or services featured in or around the games.</p>
<p>Each model has its own advantages and disadvantages. Online subscription is popular because it is affordable and people can access a large library of games. It also generates recurring revenue for the business. However, it can be difficult to attract new subscribers and retain existing ones. Pay-per-game&#x2F;event is popular because it allows users to only pay for the games they want to play, which makes it more affordable. However, it can be difficult to generate revenue from this model since users may only play one or two games. Advertising is popular because it allows businesses to reach a large audience at a low cost. However, it can be difficult to create an effective advertising campaign that generates results.</p>
<p>The Key Components of a Successful Sports Gaming Business</p>
<p>There are four key components of a successful sports gaming business: content, technology, marketing, and operations. Let’s take a closer look at each one.</p>
<p>Content is arguably the most important component of any sports gaming business. Content includes the games themselves as well as any other content such as articles, videos, etc. The quality of your content will determine whether people stick around and become paying customers. Technology is also important because it enables you to create and deliver your content effectively and efficiently. Marketing is critical because you need to reach your target audience effectively in order to generate sales. And finally, operations are important because they ensure that your business runs smoothly on a day-to-day basis.</p>

If the amount wagered is less than $20, the penalty is a Class C misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $500. If the amount wagered is more than $20 but less than $100, the penalty is a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $2,000 and&#x2F;or imprisonment for up to 180 days. If the amount wagered is more than $100, the penalty is a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $4,000 and&#x2F;or imprisonment for up to one year.</p>
<p>In addition to any criminal penalties, those who engage in illegal gambling may also be subject to civil penalties. The Texas Attorney General may file a lawsuit seeking an injunction to prohibit illegal gambling, as well as civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day. Furthermore, any person who suffers injury or losses as a result of illegal gambling may sue for damages.</p>
<h1 id="Texas-Gambling-Laws-Strict-Carry-Heavy-Penalties"><a href="#Texas-Gambling-Laws-Strict-Carry-Heavy-Penalties" class="headerlink" title="Texas Gambling Laws Strict, Carry Heavy Penalties"></a>Texas Gambling Laws Strict, Carry Heavy Penalties</h1><p>Gambling is illegal in Texas, and penalties for breaking the law are severe.</p>
<p>Under Texas law, gambling is defined as “the playing of games of chance or skill for money or other thing of value.” This includes activities such as casino games, poker, bingo, and sports betting.</p>
<p>Texas Penal Code section 47.02 prohibits gambling, and violators can be punished with a fine of up to $10,000 and&#x2F;or up to two years in jail. Additionally, those convicted of gambling may be ordered to pay restitution to any victims.</p>
<p>The law also prohibits promoting or advertising gambling, which can lead to criminal charges if done knowingly or intentionally.</p>
<p>Despite the strict penalties for gambling in Texas, the state does have a few regulated forms of gambling. These include charitable bingo and raffles, as well as the lottery.</p>

At the time of his firing, the university issued a statement saying that it had “mutually agreed to terminate Coach Fritz’s employment effective immediately” due to an ongoing NCAA investigation into possible rules violations.

That’s where online casinos come in: they allow you to play your favourite games from the comfort of your home.</p>
<p>However, as with anything else on the internet, it’s important to be careful when choosing an online casino to play at.

<p>L’Auberge Casino Resort is a 1,000-acre property that features 362 rooms and suites, as well as 68,000 square feet of casino space with more than 1,500 slot machines and 36 table games. It also includes a full-service spa, five restaurants, and a variety of entertainment options.</p>
<p>The acquisition is expected to close in January 2019.</p>
<h1 id="New-Owner-of-L’Auberge-Casino-Resort-Announced"><a href="#New-Owner-of-L’Auberge-Casino-Resort-Announced" class="headerlink" title="New Owner of L’Auberge Casino Resort Announced"></a>New Owner of L’Auberge Casino Resort Announced</h1><p>The new owner of L’Auberge Casino Resort has been announced. JF Dongarra, a business mogul from Dallas, Texas, has bought the casino and resort for an undisclosed amount.</p>
<p>Dongarra is the founder and CEO of JFD Group, a holding company with business interests in real estate, hospitality, oil and gas production, and more. He is also the owner of the Omni Hotel in downtown Dallas.</p>
<p>L’Auberge Casino Resort is a major employer in the Baton Rouge area and is one of the most popular destinations in Louisiana for tourists. The casino features over 1,500 slot machines and gaming tables, as well as a variety of restaurants and bars. It also features a large hotel with over 500 rooms.</p>

<p>Dongarra did not give any specifics about his plans for the casino and resort, but said that he was looking forward to working with the local community and creating jobs. He also praised the hardworking employees at L’Auberge and said that they would be a top priority for him.</p>
<p>Local officials welcomed the news of Dongarra’s purchase. “We are excited to have Mr. Dongarra as our new partner,” said Mayor Sharon Weston Broome. “He brings a wealth of experience in the hospitality industry and we look forward to working with him to continue to make L’Auberge one of the top destinations in Louisiana.”</p>
<h1 id="Billionaire-Investor-Purchases-L’Auberge-Casino-Resort"><a href="#Billionaire-Investor-Purchases-L’Auberge-Casino-Resort" class="headerlink" title="Billionaire Investor Purchases L’Auberge Casino Resort"></a>Billionaire Investor Purchases L’Auberge Casino Resort</h1><p>Billionaire investor Carl Icahn has agreed to purchase L’Auberge Casino Resort in Baton Rouge, Louisiana from Pinnacle Entertainment for $616 million.</p>
<p>L’Auberge Casino Resort is a AAA Four Diamond resort that features 122,000 square feet of casino gaming space, including 1,600 slot machines and 90 table games. The property also features a 54-room hotel, spa, and several restaurants.</p>
<p>The acquisition of L’Auberge Casino Resort marks Icahn’s entry into the Louisiana gambling market. In a statement announcing the deal, Icahn said he was “excited to have the opportunity to own and operate a top-notch casino resort in Baton Rouge.”</p>
<p>Pinnacle Entertainment had been seeking a buyer for L’Auberge Casino Resort since last year, when the company put itself up for sale. In November 2017, Pinnacle reached an agreement to sell the property to Eldorado Resorts for $873 million, but the deal fell through in February 2018.</p>
<p>Icahn is no stranger to the casino industry. The 80-year-old investor is currently the largest shareholder of Tropicana Entertainment, which owns and operates nine casinos and resorts in the United States.</p>
<h1 id="Renowned-Casino-Resort-Sold-to-Unknown-Investor"><a href="#Renowned-Casino-Resort-Sold-to-Unknown-Investor" class="headerlink" title="Renowned Casino Resort Sold to Unknown Investor"></a>Renowned Casino Resort Sold to Unknown Investor</h1><p>The world-renowned casino resort known as “The Strip” has been sold to an unknown investor for an undisclosed amount of money. The new owner is said to be a reclusive businessperson who has never been involved in the casino industry before.</p>
<p>This news has come as a shock to many employees and guests of the establishment, as the new owner has made no indication that he plans to change anything about the resort. In a statement, the reclusive investor said only that he is “very excited about this new venture” and hopes to “make Las Vegas even more famous than it already is.”</p>
<p>When asked for comment, employees of the casino resort were tight-lipped, saying only that they are “waiting to see what happens next.” Regular guests of the casino were also reluctant to speak on the record, but all seemed to agree that the sale was something of a surprise.</p>
<p>The Strip has been a fixture of Las Vegas since its construction in 1971. It was originally built by Howard Hughes and has had several different owners over the years. The resort is known for its luxurious accommodations, including several high-end restaurants and a world-class spa.</p>
<h1 id="Mystery-Investor-Buys-Louisiana’s-L’Auberge-Casino-Resort"><a href="#Mystery-Investor-Buys-Louisiana’s-L’Auberge-Casino-Resort" class="headerlink" title="Mystery Investor Buys Louisiana’s L’Auberge Casino Resort"></a>Mystery Investor Buys Louisiana’s L’Auberge Casino Resort</h1><p>The future of Louisiana’s L’Auberge Casino Resort is now in the hands of a mystery investor.</p>
<p>On Monday, it was announced that the casino had been sold to an unidentified individual for an undisclosed sum. This comes after a long and difficult process to find a buyer for the property.</p>
<p>L’Auberge Casino Resort has been operational since 2012 and was one of the first major gambling establishments to open in the state. It features a 300-room hotel, a 30,000-square-foot gaming floor, and several restaurants.</p>
<p>However, it has faced significant financial difficulties in recent years. In 2017, its parent company declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This led to the casino being put up for sale later that year.</p>
<p>The identity of the new owner has not been released, but they are expected to keep the property running as is. Representatives from L’Auberge Casino Resort have declined to comment on the sale.</p>
